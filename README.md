# Comparison of AB Test and Conversion of Bidding Methods

## Description
This is a case study from Data Scientist Bootcamp of "miuul".

## Business Problem
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding" type. One of our customers, xyz.com, decided to test this new feature to determine if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding. An A/B test has been ongoing for 1 month, and xyz.com now expects you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success metric for xyz.com is Purchase. Therefore, the Purchase metric should be focused on for statistical tests.

## Dataset Story
This dataset contains website information for a company, including data such as the number of ad impressions and clicks, as well as earnings from the purchased products. There are two separate datasets: the control group, which used Maximum Bidding, and the test group, which used Average Bidding. These datasets are on separate sheets of the ab_testing.xlsx excel file.

* impression: Number of ad impressions
* Click: Number of clicks on the displayed ads
* Purchase: Number of products purchased after clicking on the ads
* Earning: Earnings obtained from the purchased products
